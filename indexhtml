<h1> Should Mulan be considered to be Disney princess? </h1>
<table> <tr>
<td> There is a lot of debate on whether or no mulan should be a consider a Disney princess or not. Mulan is a disney-animated movie, that came out in the late-1990s, centered around and girl who takes her father place in the Chinese army. She is not your typical disney princess, as she doesn’t subscribe to typical gender roles, where the only way a girl can bring honor to her family is by being married into a good family. By taking her father place in the army, she is completely high treason, but she does this to save her father, even if action brings upon her death. In the end, she saves China from the hans invaders and receive a Medal of Honor from the emperor. Throughout the movie she finds strength in her abilities (with her knowledge in military techniques) and learns to love her true self (to follow your heart no matter what).

</td> <td> The debate is stemmed off of the fact that mulan was not born or married into royalty. She is simply the daughter of a war hero and her love interest is also the son of a great general, which in the technical term just makes them everyday citizen. Disney however has redefined to definition of princess in recent years, with their Dream Big, Princess campaign. Disney defines a princess as some who exhibits qualities that a young child can look up too, such as courage and bravery. All the princess give children a lesson, such princess tiana is make you dreams real and princess Ariel is explore an new world. Mulan teaches the lesson of finding your inner warrior. Some have also argued that Disney only included her in the line up to promote diversity, as she is the first East Asian Disney Princess bring more diversity to the princess line up.

<h4> What do I think? </h4>
<p> 
Personally, I believe Mulan is a Disney Princess, if not one of the greatest Disney princesses made. She was a turning point in the archetype of a Disney Princess. She is one of the first princesses to not get married at the end of her movie, showing a new wave of feminism not see before. She showed a great amount of courage, bravery, and intelligence, not seen in other movies. She is a great inspiration to children everywhere, no matter the gender. She has qualities that both girls and boys can have, but most associated with males. She is the very definition of what a princess should be according to the Disney Princess Dream Big campaign. Therefore I would conclude that, not only is Mulan a Disney Princess, she is one of the greatest princesses ever made. Without her, some of other favorite Disney Princess probably wouldn’t be around today. She is a trendsetter and an inspiration.
